    <h2> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>  The testing of the digital solutions is a very important part i think 
        and how i did it was to do some parts of the coding and then test it 
        straight away and every time i would change something on my webpage i
         would see if it ran smoothly with out errors but as being on your own
          as well its not as easy to spot errors as it would be as a team so i
           made sure to test more often as i could, using the zoom calls with the 
           teacher is an advantage because you can share your screen and they would
            help you with the testing and to spot any errors you may have missed or 
            even just using slack to message them to get advice. <br>
             I would assess the overall product usability, performance and compatibility 
             after getting any advice or talking to the teacher. <br>
              whilst using the visual studio code to do this project made it better to
               spot errors as its got its own capability of spotting errors in the coding 
               side of it which would show me any errors of code that wouldn't be right. <br>
                I would go on to the website its self to see if it works by clicking on
                 certain parts that was supposed to be links and see if it goes to the 
                 right destination, as in like each question i did and see if it goes to
                  the correct page where the answer was or any website links that go to a 
                  completely different site, and make sure its the correct website. </p>
