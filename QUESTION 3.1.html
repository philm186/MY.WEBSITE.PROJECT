    <h2> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of 
        productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making
         your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
         <br>
         <br>

         <p> There are always going to be benefits and drawbacks for everything as nothing is perfect. <br> 
              As i used the the visual studio code i found many benefits for it, like the actual 
              layout is very easily worked around and it can automatically help you with certain 
              codes you put in by predicting what you might type, the only draw back i would say 
              and i actually think it might be just my laptop than a fault of visual studio code 
              and that is when i split the screen into two, so i have maybe html up and css up at
               the same time its a bit to small and pushed together. <br> 
               Trello has its great features that would benefit alot of companies of maybe a larger
                group project as you can easily keep track of every ones individual work. <br> 
                I think it could work as a team effort again like the python project as it would make
                 things run smoother and some IT tools and systems would be used in a more productive way,
                  everyone always had there stronger points and could do the tasks others felt not as good at,
                   so you could split the work into each member to get the best out of everyone and the project.  </p>
