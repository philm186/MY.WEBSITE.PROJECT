        <p> my name is philip matthews and i am 33 years old and one of my favortie 
            things to do is watch films and tv series, at the minute i am a big marvel 
           i enjoy to work with my hands and do a bit of DIY when i can, i recently made my 
           own coffee table with some scap wood my friend had spare. I enjoy to visit my family  
           and have a darts from time to time  and playing video games with friends but not as
            much as i use to nowadays. <br>
            <br>
            In the past i have worked in a bank on the cashier which i found easy to do all the 
            transactions but didnt like the part where you bug customers in buying cedrtain products(sales side of it)
            it just seem like they want there monthly points hit rather than helping the customers, and it was the elderly that 
            ended up getting things they didnt need really. <br>
            I also used to be a laminate floor fitting which i really enjoyed doing because i got to work with friends and i was good at it
            even had contracts at times to work on site and fit floors for loads of brand new flats in manchester
