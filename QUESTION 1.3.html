    <h1 style="text-align:center"style> QUESTION 1.3</h1>
    <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? .</h2>


  <p>
    firstly i will be learning the coding side of the website before i design the 
    layout and using trello which is a way of planning out every question that will 
     be on the site and you can make boards on trello that will help you plan out the 
      tasks that you have to come and organise the things you do in an order that will 
       suit you and make this project easier to make. using slack helps to communicate 
        with the teacher if i have any problems i need help with. 
         To make the website i will need the most obvious I.T product, a computer and 
          using visual studio code program i will create the html codes to make a basic 
           website layout an then using CSS to style the whole thing to making it look appealing.
