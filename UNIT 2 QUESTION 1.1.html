<h1 style="text-align:center"style>  UNIT 2 QUESTION 1.1</h1>
<h2>Describing the content and layout for each page?</h2>


<p>The main page is going to have all the questions and answers that are needed on the 
    front  clearly seen and will each have a link to each answer leading to a another 
    website part . i will have a background with a warm and welcoming theme and will 
    have some pictures on there to make it more visually appealing. i will make it  as 
    user friendly as i can, as not to make it difficult to use for any visitors.
    There will also be links to pages about me and one for contact details.
    i am going to have a reference link to show any websites i used to help me with t
    he coding, and also a picture link for "codenation" at the bottom 
    Each page you go to will have the paragraph's in there own  colour so its easier 
    to read and each page will have the answer to all the question that we are supposed
     to do in paragraphs big enough to read. at the very top will be the home button to 
     link back to the main page, there will be a "about me " button and link to a page 
     to give you a little more information about myself. then another button called contact 
     which will have details of my contact information, and one more button that wil be references,
     which will have website links of all the websites i used for help with some of the questions.
