    <h2> Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p>   The ways that would improve productivity and efficiency and a number of things,
         as every knows trying to do too much for a long period of time can blank your mind
          so i suggest that taking regular breaks away from the computer, for one it helps 
          your eyes have a rest from a screen and you can clear your mind and will be able 
          to think more effectively , doing yoga can be a good exercise to calm yourself if your overwhelmed. <br>
        keeping on track of one task at a time instead of running a few at a time makes productivity better. <br>
        There is one major thing i would say to always do and that is to eat when your
         hungry and drink when your thirsty as your judgments are not the same when you need
          food or drink and you can make errors or mistakes or even make your self unwell by not eating proper. </p>
