    <h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>

    <p>
So first off GDPR stands for of General Data Protection Regulation, 
This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across
the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling 
to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including 
companies on other continents. What GDPR means is that citizens of the
 EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances
 that their information is being securely protected across Europe. 
According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related 
 to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates 
  on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a 
  computer IP address. there are 8 basic rights of the GDPR which are. 
  The right to access, The right to be forgotten, The right to data portability, 
   The right to be informed, The right to have information corrected, 
    The right to restrict processing, The right to object and The right to be notified. 
The impact it can have would be that The conditions for obtaining consent are 
stricter under GDPR requirements as the individual must have the right to withdraw 
consent at any time and there is a presumption that consent will not be valid unless 
 separate consents are obtained for different processing activities,  This means 
  you have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action, 
  to receive a newsletter for instance. It is not allowed to assume or add a 
  disclaimer, and providing an opt-out option is not enough.
