    <h1 style="text-align:center"style> QUESTION 1.5</h1>
    <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software â€“ how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
  
  <p>
    deciding what type of I.T systems and software can be hard and even stressful 
     as you most probably always want the best, but you could be stopped by the 
      budget you have to spend on the equipment or maybe you just dont know where 
      to start looking. I would first look at the job you are doing and find out 
      what software would be best to run it, you can google websites to compare 
      products and even find forums of real people who have used certain software 
      or maybe they have the same type of business or project your doing and you can get advice. 
    maybe Create a list of software requirements you may need. 
    Usability requirements, Technological preferences and Budgetary requirements would be a great start. 
    You can even trial some out before you buy, to see what best suits you.
