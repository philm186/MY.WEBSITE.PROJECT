        <h1 style="text-align:center"> QUESTION 2.1</h1>

        <h2> Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ 
            in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?  </h2>
<br>
<br>

<p>   I found some tools helpful and others not, first off, using my laptop for 
    going onto websites to research on coding and help with answering some of the
     questions helped a lot as the internet is probably the biggest tool to use 
     and you will always find some help on any situation you need. <br> Using slack
      was useful as well because you can easily communicate with the teacher and 
      others about the course work, share any coding ideas and just general chat 
      if you needed to have a break from the work. <br> Using trello started of fine
       when i was sorting out all the questions and answers then i could easily
        transfer to my webpage later, but when we was learning more things and had
         to start coding it got a bit much having to remember to also go and update 
         trello, it felt like another task in its self to do when i needed to focus 
         on the coding. <br> The software visual studio code was the best piece of tool
         to use and very helpful and easily used, but the more information i got on 
         how to do different coding did get a bit harder to keep up with it all.  </p>
