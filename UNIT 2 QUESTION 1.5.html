<p>copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your
    permission and protects your work of authorship, including text, graphics, 
     photographs ,sound recordings and audio visual elements of websites and 
      their underlying computer programs. It prevents people from copying your 
       work and distributing copies of it, it even stops them from renting, lending, 
        performing, showing or playing your work in public. they cant make 
        adaptation of your work. other constraints affecting websites could be if 
         your designing a website for a client and they don't find your design 
         fit with their brand. What if your design takes a long time to develop?
         you may either miss the deadlines or just can’t meet the client’s expectations 
          as a result of not considering the unique constraints of your design project. 
    you need to know where and when to spend resources and energy in the project as per 
     budgetary and other constraints.
