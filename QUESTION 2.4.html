<h2> Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p> Any further improvements made to my project could of been alot as there are 
        so many possibilities available to be creative if given more time as i didnt 
        consider the restrains i would have with the time i had to finish. <br> 
        I could of learnt more ways of coding to have other features on my webpage 
        and make it even more better but obviously coding is a very large subject to 
        learn and probably takes years for anyone to master, but given the time i had 
        i have got a vast amount of experience and feel i can take something away from
         this and i can improve over time. <br> If i could of done this down at codnation
          i think it would of helped being there as online courses are not the easy task.
           (but given the circumstances of covid19 we all know why we are at home doing these courses ) 
        but i feel like i could do better being in the same room as everyone and the teacher which 
    makes it easy to get help and advice. </p>
