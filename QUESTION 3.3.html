    <h2> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“
         what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
         <br>
         <br>

         <p>   I think to develop solutions  to improve my own productivity using  IT in 
             digital projects would entail maybe doing this in teams as you can have team 
             briefings at the start of the day and brain storm every ones ideas and plan 
             the days tasks ahead whilst assigning each member a certain job to do which
              would split the project up and make it easier for everyone to focus on their 
              individual task, Using slack would also be an improvement for the team for 
              many reasons like file staring to one another and easy communication through
               the chat and setting a team leader so you have a more organised team. <br> 
               trello would effect your team into a less overwhelmed as if being on your own 
               trying to do it all by yourself, it gives the tasks that are set the better
                view of the project and lets all team members have  control over the board 
                and split the load into several tasks that can be seen what needs to be done 
                and what has been done and who is doing which task. Using zoom or google meet
                 in your teams would help a lot as its a place to all link up and chat with
                  each other about the project.
