    <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects â€“ what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
 

  <br>
  
  
  <p>
    The risks that might impact digital projects could be something not going to plan. 
    risk is a reality with most aspects of business, digital projects rarely happen 
    under ideal circumstances. They can require a broad convergence of people, 
    systems and data. even doing your best is not always possible to have every answer 
     to every question. And even if you do, things can change all the time. 
    things that could go wrong could be you develop a website and your 5 or 6 months 
     into it and a new ios is developed and your site might not be compatible. 
    you could have problems with recruitment or resources, do you have the time to  
    find the right person for the job or even have the budget you need for the resources
