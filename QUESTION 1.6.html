    <h2>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. â€“ How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
 
  <p>
    Using trello this time round as an individual project has helped a bit  
    more as i can easily sort out all my questions in order before moving 
    on to the web design and take anything i need from here like the answers 
    i have already found. i can copy and paste them to the relevant places onto my website. 
    it also helps for the teacher to be able to see your trello board and can 
     help you by giving advice on anything that you might need to improve. 
    I like that i can put them into different sections of like, "done" or "doing" etc, 
     then i know what parts to finish of or anything that doesnt need to be looked at
