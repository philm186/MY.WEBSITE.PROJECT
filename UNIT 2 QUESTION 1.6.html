<h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them?</h2>



<p>There are a several issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages, 
     depending on there condition, for example if some one is blind or visually impaired 
      they could use the keyboard without having problems so they could use a screen 
      reader to interpret what is displayed on the screen and drive a combination of
      speech output and braille output. they can use the speech output for rapid review 
       of the text in a document and use the refreshable braille output to check the exact 
        wording of text since braille gives a more precise rendering of what is on a page. 
    there are people that are deaf and will rely on audio content or Motor disabilities 
    that can include weakness, limitations of muscular control and will have to use a 
     specialized mouse, a keyboard with a layout of keys that matches their range of motion.
    Individuals with learning disabilities may have difficulty processing written language
    or images and may rely on getting information through several modalities at the same time. 
    someone who has difficulty reading may use speech output to facilitate comprehension, 
     while someone with an auditory learning disability may use captions to help understand 
     an audio track.
