<h2> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?</h2>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>   my strengths and weaknesses on a project like this are harder to assess, 
        as this is my first time doing any sort of coding, but the days went on and
         i learnt more and more about different ways. I found the hardest thing was
          remembering so much information that was given to me each day and having
           to complete the project it such a short time. <br> I normally am a fast
            learner and given time to do certain parts would be easier to learn and 
            then move on to another part. <br>  I am quite good on a computer and can 
            work around it very well, so when the tools we was given for the project i 
            easily soon picked it up. <br> I am happy with parts of my website like 
            the way it looks and how clear the information i have given is, i found 
            the flexbox the hardest of it all to get started but maybe given more time 
            to work it out i would eventually become better at it. </p>
