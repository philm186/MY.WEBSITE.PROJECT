<h2> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>  The outcomes seem to match the requirements as i have taken a look at my 
        site and reviewed it with the content of unit 1, like the fact that i collected
         all the appropriate content for my site and i was very organised in my webpages
         whilst using different techniques and styles. i checked for any errors in my page
          by trying it out and testing all the links and all the different pages whilst 
          following the guidelines of the project . I feel like i answered every question 
          that was needed in the project and i am quite satisfied  </p>
