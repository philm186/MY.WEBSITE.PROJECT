    <h2> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate </h2>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p> The tools that we used was appropriate as i dont think without visual studio code
         i could of done the things i have created using it, as the features on there was 
         most useful, like when you first start typing something and a list of pre set 
         option appear and you can select which you want, it can help speed the process
          up or even give you options that you haven't tried and can test them out,
        the features on trello are good in there own way, once you figure out how to use
         it then it works efficiently for you, but maybe it would be more effective for a 
         larger group task rather than a solo one. <br> 
        Slack is another one that was use full and appropriate as you can communicate with others
        and share files if needed or ideas, but also just for general chat for when your taking 
        a break and you can unwind so you dont get to stressed with all the work.    </p>
